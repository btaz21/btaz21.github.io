## Chicago Landmarks App
============================

The Chicago Landmarks App allows you to search the Chicago Open Data Portal for historical landmarks by year they were built. In addition to showing a list of names, you will have the option to see other relevant info on each landmark (i.e. architect, designation date, address).

#Issues
-------
-Getting iframes to connect within page.

-Finding a way to pass in a search query to these iframes so that it opens directly to the page you want and not just a search query

-Getting pages to scroll down

-Getting @media query to work on my phone, despite pixel size being correct

-Page not refreshing to top

-Having to clean up the data
ex. landmark designation date
